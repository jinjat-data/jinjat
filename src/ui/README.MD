### Headless in Routing

For the routing, Refine's headless approach shines too. It doesn't tie you to a single routing method or library. Instead, it offers a simple routing interface with built-in integrations for popular libraries.

This means you can use Refine seamlessly on different platforms like React Native, Electron, Next.js, Remix, etc. without any extra setup steps.

## Quick Start

There are two ways to create a Refine app: either by using the `create refine-app` CLI tool or the [browser-based app scaffolder](https://refine.dev/#playground).

To quickly start a Refine project with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as the default UI framework, run the following command.

```
npm create refine-app@latest -- -o refine-antd
```

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project folder and start your project with:

```
npm run dev
```

Your **Refine** application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173):

> Note: The command above uses pre-set options for ease. For a different tech stack, simply run:
>
> ```
> npm create refine-app@latest
> ```
